# Fundamental Concepts Research

## Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability (CIA)

The CIA triad is a widely used model to guide information security policies.

*   **Confidentiality:** Ensures that information is not disclosed to unauthorized individuals, entities, or processes.
    *   **Examples:** Encryption, access controls, data classification.
*   **Integrity:** Maintains the accuracy, consistency, and trustworthiness of data over its entire lifecycle. Data should not be altered or destroyed in an unauthorized manner.
    *   **Examples:** Hashing, digital signatures, version control.
*   **Availability:** Guarantees that authorized users can access information and resources when needed.
    *   **Examples:** Redundancy, backups, disaster recovery plans.

## Non-Repudiation

Non-repudiation provides proof of the origin, integrity, and delivery of data. It ensures that a party in a communication cannot later deny their participation.

**Examples:**
*   **Digital Signatures:** Used to verify the authenticity and integrity of a digital message or document.
*   **Email Tracking:** Provides proof that an email was sent and received.
*   **Audit Trails:** A record of events that have occurred on a system.

## Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA)

AAA is a framework for intelligently controlling access to computer resources, enforcing policies, auditing usage, and providing the information necessary to bill for services.

*   **Authentication:** The process of verifying the identity of a user.
    *   **Examples:** Passwords, biometrics, smart cards.
*   **Authorization:** The process of granting or denying access to a user based on their identity and the policies in place.
    *   **Examples:** Access control lists (ACLs), role-based access control (RBAC).
*   **Accounting:** The process of tracking user activity and resource consumption.
    *   **Examples:** Log files, billing systems.

## Zero Trust

Zero trust is a security model based on the principle of "never trust, always verify." It assumes that no user or device is trusted by default, regardless of whether they are inside or outside the network perimeter.

**Key Principles:**
*   **Strict Identity Verification:** All users and devices must be authenticated and authorized before accessing resources.
*   **Least Privilege Access:** Users are only given the minimum level of access they need to do their jobs.
*   **Micro-segmentation:** The network is divided into small, isolated segments to limit the lateral movement of attackers.
*   **Continuous Monitoring:** All network traffic is monitored for suspicious activity.

## Deception/Disruption Technology

Deception technology uses decoys and lures to detect, deceive, and defend against attacks. Disruption technology is used to disrupt the attacker's ability to achieve their objectives.

**Examples of Deception Technology:**
*   **Honeypots:** Decoy systems that are designed to attract attackers.
*   **Honeynets:** Networks of honeypots.
*   **Honeytokens:** Decoy data, such as fake credentials, that can be used to track attackers.

**Examples of Disruption Technology:**
*   **Denial-of-Service (DoS) Attacks:** Used to make a system or network unavailable to legitimate users.
*   **Ransomware:** Malware that encrypts a victim's files and demands a ransom to decrypt them.
*   **Watering Hole Attacks:** Compromising a website that is likely to be visited by a specific group of users.
