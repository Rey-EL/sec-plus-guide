# Change Management

## What is Change Management?
Change management is a formal process for making changes to IT systems. The goal is to ensure that changes are made in a controlled and coordinated manner, to minimize the risk of disruption to services and to ensure that the changes are beneficial to the organization.

## Why is Change Management Important?
Without a formal change management process, changes can be made in an ad-hoc manner, leading to a number of problems, including:
*   **Outages:** Unplanned outages can occur if changes are not properly tested or if they conflict with other systems.
*   **Security vulnerabilities:** Changes can introduce new security vulnerabilities if they are not properly reviewed.
*   **Lack of visibility:** It can be difficult to track what changes have been made, by whom, and when. This can make it difficult to troubleshoot problems and to plan for future changes.

## Who is Involved in Change Management?
A number of people are typically involved in the change management process, including:
*   **The person making the change:** This is the person who is responsible for implementing the change.
*   **The change advisory board (CAB):** This is a group of people who are responsible for reviewing and approving changes. The CAB typically includes representatives from different parts of the organization, such as IT, security, and business units.
*   **Stakeholders:** These are the people who will be affected by the change. It is important to communicate with stakeholders throughout the change management process to ensure that they are aware of the change and that they have an opportunity to provide feedback.

## How is Change Management Implemented?
The change management process typically includes the following steps:
1.  **Request for change (RFC):** The person making the change submits an RFC to the CAB. The RFC should describe the change, the reason for the change, and the potential impact of the change.
2.  **Review and approval:** The CAB reviews the RFC and decides whether to approve it. The CAB may ask for more information or may require that the change be tested before it is approved.
3.  **Implementation:** Once the change is approved, it is implemented by the person who requested the change.
4.  **Testing:** The change is tested to ensure that it is working as expected and that it has not introduced any new problems.
5.  **Documentation:** The change is documented so that there is a record of what was changed, when it was changed, and by whom.

## Business Processes in Change Management
Change management is a business process that helps to ensure that changes to IT systems are made in a controlled and coordinated manner. The change management process should be integrated with other business processes, such as project management and service management.

## Technical Implications of Change Management
Change management has a number of technical implications, including:
*   **Version control:** It is important to use a version control system to track changes to code and configurations. This will allow you to roll back to a previous version if necessary.
*   **Testing:** It is important to test changes thoroughly before they are implemented. This will help to ensure that they do not introduce any new problems.
*   **Automation:** Automation can be used to automate the change management process. This can help to reduce the risk of human error and to improve the efficiency of the process.

## Documentation in Change Management
Documentation is a critical part of the change management process. The following should be documented for each change:
*   The RFC
*   The approval of the RFC
*   The implementation plan
*   The test plan
*   The results of the testing
*   The backout plan

## Version Control in Change Management
Version control is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later. For source code, version control systems (VCS) are an indispensable tool for developers. They allow developers to work on the same codebase without overwriting each other's work. They also allow developers to track changes to the codebase and to roll back to a previous version if necessary.
