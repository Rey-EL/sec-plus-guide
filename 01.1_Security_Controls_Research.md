# Security Controls Research

## Technical Controls

**What it is:** Technical controls (also known as logical controls) are security measures that are implemented and executed by computer systems and other technology. They are designed to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data and systems.

**Examples:**
*   **Encryption:** Encrypting data at rest and in transit to make it unreadable to unauthorized users.
*   **Firewalls:** Network security devices that monitor and filter incoming and outgoing network traffic based on an organization's previously established security policies.
*   **Antivirus and Anti-Malware Software:** Software that detects, prevents, and removes malicious software.
*   **Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) and Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS):** Systems that monitor network or system activities for malicious activity or policy violations and can either report on them (IDS) or actively block them (IPS).
*   **Access Control Lists (ACLs):** Rules that grant or deny access to resources.
*   **Authentication and Authorization Mechanisms:** Systems like passwords, biometrics, smart cards, and multi-factor authentication (MFA) that verify a user's identity and determine what they are allowed to do.

## Preventive Controls

**What it is:** Preventive controls are designed to stop a security incident from happening in the first place. They are proactive measures that aim to prevent unauthorized access or actions.

**Examples:**
*   **Security Policies and Procedures:** Clearly defined rules and guidelines for how to handle data and access systems.
*   **Security Awareness Training:** Educating employees about security risks and how to avoid them.
*   **Physical Barriers:** Fences, walls, and doors that restrict physical access.
*   **Access Control:** Limiting access to systems and data to only authorized individuals.
*   **Hardening:** The process of securing a system by reducing its surface of vulnerability.
*   **Encryption:** As a preventive control, encryption prevents data from being read if it is stolen.

## Managerial Controls

**What it is:** Managerial controls (also known as administrative controls) are security measures that focus on the management of risk and the management of information security. They are policies, procedures, and guidelines that are established by management.

**Examples:**
*   **Risk Assessment:** The process of identifying, analyzing, and evaluating risk.
*   **Security Policies:** High-level statements of management's intent for security.
*   **Security Awareness and Training:** Programs to educate users about security.
*   **Contingency Planning:** Planning for how to respond to and recover from a security incident.
*   **Hiring and Termination Policies:** Procedures for background checks and for revoking access when an employee leaves.

## Deterrent Controls

**What it is:** Deterrent controls are designed to discourage potential attackers from attempting to violate security policies. They work by making an attack seem more difficult or costly.

**Examples:**
*   **Warning Banners:** Messages displayed on computer screens that warn of the consequences of unauthorized access.
*   **Security Guards:** The presence of security personnel can deter physical attacks.
*   **Security Cameras:** Visible cameras can deter theft and vandalism.
*   **Threat of Legal Action:** The knowledge that an organization will pursue legal action against attackers can be a deterrent.

## Operational Controls

**What it is:** Operational controls are security measures that are primarily implemented and executed by people. They are day-to-day procedures that help to protect data and systems.

**Examples:**
*   **Backups and Recovery:** Regularly backing up data and having a plan to restore it in the event of a disaster.
*   **Incident Response:** The procedures for responding to a security incident.
*   **Change Management:** A formal process for making changes to systems to ensure that they are done in a secure manner.
*   **User Training:** Ongoing training for users on security best practices.

## Detective Controls

**What it is:** Detective controls are designed to detect security incidents after they have occurred. They are reactive measures that help to identify and respond to a breach.

**Examples:**
*   **Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS):** Systems that monitor network or system activities for malicious activity or policy violations and report on them.
*   **Security Audits:** The process of reviewing security logs and other records to look for signs of a breach.
*   **Log Monitoring:** Regularly reviewing system and network logs for suspicious activity.
*   **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) systems:** Tools that collect and analyze security data from a variety of sources to provide a unified view of an organization's security posture.

## Physical Controls

**What it is:** Physical controls are security measures that are designed to protect the physical security of an organization's assets. This includes buildings, equipment, and data.

**Examples:**
*   **Locks:** Physical locks on doors and windows.
*   **Fences and Walls:** Physical barriers to restrict access to a facility.
*   **Security Guards:** Personnel who monitor and control access to a facility.
*   **Fire Suppression Systems:** Systems to extinguish fires and protect equipment.
*   **Environmental Controls:** HVAC systems to maintain a proper temperature and humidity for computer equipment.

## Corrective Controls

**What it is:** Corrective controls are designed to correct a security incident after it has occurred. They are reactive measures that help to restore systems and data to their normal state.

**Examples:**
*   **Incident Response Plan:** The plan for how to respond to and recover from a security incident.
*   **Disaster Recovery Plan:** The plan for how to recover from a major disaster.
*   **Backups and Restoration:** The process of restoring data from a backup.
*   **Patch Management:** The process of applying security patches to systems to fix vulnerabilities.

## Compensating Controls

**What it is:** Compensating controls are security measures that are put in place to satisfy the requirement for a security measure that is deemed too difficult or impractical to implement at the present time.

**Examples:**
*   **Multi-factor authentication (MFA):** If a system cannot support strong passwords, MFA can be used as a compensating control.
*   **Increased monitoring:** If a system cannot be patched, increased monitoring can be used to detect an attack.
*   **Data encryption:** If data cannot be physically secured, it can be encrypted to protect it from unauthorized access.

## Directive Controls

**What it is:** Directive controls are security measures that are designed to specify acceptable rules of behavior within an organization. They are policies, procedures, and guidelines that are established by management.

**Examples:**
*   **Acceptable Use Policy (AUP):** A policy that defines the acceptable use of an organization's computer and network resources.
*   **Security Policies:** High-level statements of management's intent for security.
*   **Laws and Regulations:** Government and industry regulations that an organization must comply with.
*   **Standards and Guidelines:** Documents that provide specific details on how to implement security policies.
