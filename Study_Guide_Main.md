## 1.1: Security Controls

### Technical Controls

*   **Who:** Implemented by IT security teams and managed by system administrators. Affects all users and systems interacting with the protected environment.
*   **What:** Technical controls (also known as logical controls) are security measures that are implemented and executed by computer systems and other technology. They are designed to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data and systems.
*   **Where:** Within computer systems, networks, and applications.
*   **When:** Continuously active, enforcing security policies in real-time.
*   **Why:** To protect data and systems from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction.
*   **How:** Through mechanisms like:
    *   **Encryption:** Encrypting data at rest and in transit to make it unreadable to unauthorized users.
    *   **Firewalls:** Network security devices that monitor and filter incoming and outgoing network traffic based on an organization's previously established security policies.
    *   **Antivirus and Anti-Malware Software:** Software that detects, prevents, and removes malicious software.
    *   **Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) and Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS):** Systems that monitor network or system activities for malicious activity or policy violations and can either report on them (IDS) or actively block them (IPS).
    *   **Access Control Lists (ACLs):** Rules that grant or deny access to resources.
    *   **Authentication and Authorization Mechanisms:** Systems like passwords, biometrics, smart cards, and multi-factor authentication (MFA) that verify a user's identity and determine what they are allowed to do.

### Preventive Controls

*   **Who:** Implemented by security teams, IT staff, and adhered to by all employees.
*   **What:** Preventive controls are designed to stop a security incident from happening in the first place. They are proactive measures that aim to prevent unauthorized access or actions.
*   **Where:** Across all organizational layers, from policies to physical access points and system configurations.
*   **When:** Before an incident occurs, continuously enforced.
*   **Why:** To proactively reduce the likelihood of security breaches and unauthorized activities.
*   **How:** Through measures like:
    *   **Security Policies and Procedures:** Clearly defined rules and guidelines for how to handle data and access systems.
    *   **Security Awareness Training:** Educating employees about security risks and how to avoid them.
    *   **Physical Barriers:** Fences, walls, and doors that restrict physical access.
    *   **Access Control:** Limiting access to systems and data to only authorized individuals.
    *   **Hardening:** The process of securing a system by reducing its surface of vulnerability.
    *   **Encryption:** As a preventive control, encryption prevents data from being read if it is stolen.

### Managerial Controls

*   **Who:** Established by management and enforced by all organizational levels.
*   **What:** Managerial controls (also known as administrative controls) are security measures that focus on the management of risk and the management of information security. They are policies, procedures, and guidelines that are established by management.
*   **Where:** Within the organizational structure, policies, and operational procedures.

    *   **Hiring and Termination Policies:** Procedures for background checks and for revoking access when an employee leaves.

### Deterrent Controls

*   **Who:** Aimed at potential attackers (internal or external).
*   **What:** Deterrent controls are designed to discourage potential attackers from attempting to violate security policies. They work by making an attack seem more difficult or costly.
*   **Where:** Visible points of entry, both physical and digital.
*   **When:** Constantly present to discourage attacks.
*   **Why:** To reduce the motivation for attackers by increasing the perceived risk or effort of an attack.
*   **How:** Through visible measures such as:
    *   **Warning Banners:** Messages displayed on computer screens that warn of the consequences of unauthorized access.
    *   **Security Guards:** The presence of security personnel can deter physical attacks.
    *   **Security Cameras:** Visible cameras can deter theft and vandalism.
    *   **Threat of Legal Action:** The knowledge that an organization will pursue legal action against attackers can be a deterrent.

### Operational Controls

*   **Who:** Primarily implemented and executed by people (IT staff, security personnel, and end-users).
*   **What:** Operational controls are security measures that are primarily implemented and executed by people. They are day-to-day procedures that help to protect data and systems.
*   **Where:** Integrated into daily business processes and IT operations.
*   **When:** During routine operations and in response to specific events.
*   **Why:** To ensure the ongoing security of systems and data through consistent human action and established procedures.
*   **How:** Through procedures and practices like:
    *   **Backups and Recovery:** Regularly backing up data and having a plan to restore it in the event of a disaster.
    *   **Incident Response:** The procedures for responding to a security incident.
    *   **Change Management:** A formal process for making changes to systems to ensure that they are done in a secure manner.
    *   **User Training:** Ongoing training for users on security best practices.

### Detective Controls

*   **Who:** Utilized by security analysts, IT operations, and automated monitoring systems.
*   **What:** Detective controls are designed to detect security incidents after they have occurred. They are reactive measures that help to identify and respond to a breach.
*   **Where:** Across networks, systems, applications, and physical environments.
*   **When:** After an incident has occurred, to identify its presence and scope.
*   **Why:** To identify security breaches, policy violations, and anomalous activities that have bypassed preventive controls.
*   **How:** Through tools and processes such as:
    *   **Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS):** Systems that monitor network or system activities for malicious activity or policy violations and report on them.
    *   **Security Audits:** The process of reviewing security logs and other records to look for signs of a breach.

*   **Where:** Applied to affected systems, data, and processes.
*   **When:** After a security incident has been detected and contained.
*   **Why:** To minimize the damage from a security incident, restore normal operations, and prevent recurrence.
*   **How:** Through actions and plans such as:
    *   **Incident Response Plan:** The plan for how to respond to and recover from a security incident.
    *   **Disaster Recovery Plan:** The plan for how to recover from a major disaster.
    *   **Backups and Restoration:** The process of restoring data from a backup.
    *   **Patch Management:** The process of applying security patches to systems to fix vulnerabilities.

### Compensating Controls

*   **Who:** Implemented by security architects and IT teams when primary controls are not feasible.
*   **What:** Compensating controls are security measures that are put in place to satisfy the requirement for a security measure that is deemed too difficult or impractical to implement at the present time.
*   **Where:** Deployed in systems or environments where a primary control cannot be fully met.
*   **When:** When a required security control cannot be implemented due to technical or business constraints.
*   **Why:** To provide an equivalent level of security when the primary control is not viable, ensuring compliance and risk mitigation.
*   **How:** By implementing alternative security measures like:
    *   **Multi-factor authentication (MFA):** If a system cannot support strong passwords, MFA can be used as a compensating control.
    *   **Increased monitoring:** If a system cannot be patched, increased monitoring can be used to detect an attack.
    *   **Data encryption:** If data cannot be physically secured, it can be encrypted to protect it from unauthorized access.

### Directive Controls

*   **Who:** Established by management and followed by all employees and stakeholders.
*   **What:** Directive controls are security measures that are designed to specify acceptable rules of behavior within an organization. They are policies, procedures, and guidelines that are established by management.
*   **Where:** Documented in organizational policies, standards, and guidelines.
*   **When:** Continuously, guiding behavior and decision-making.
*   **Why:** To inform individuals of expected security behaviors, ensure compliance with regulations, and establish a secure organizational culture.
